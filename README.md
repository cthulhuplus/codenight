# Code Night
Repo for Code Night projects, planning, and activities.

## Project Ideas
Automate the provisioning of a LAMP stack
* Could be broken down into smaller activities
  * Automate the provisioning of a web server; Apache, Nginx, Litespeed, etc... and PHP
  * Automate the provisioning of a database server; MySQL, MariaDB, PostGres, etc...

Identify tasks/complex commands in your life/work that could be automated/scripted

## Documentation as Code
Write and comment your code well enough that your peers can understand and follow what your script does.  This will also help reinforce your understanding of what each piece of your code does.
